Find word simillarity and analogies using WORD2VEC

About me:
My name is Goussha,
I'm a Ph.D. student in Neurobiology, researching rodent communications and behaviors. 
During my Master's degree, I was exposed to the field of machine learning and Deep learning and having realized how powerful this tool is, I took it upon my self to learn how to use it and incorporate it in my research.

This little demo of word2vec was taken from 
https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/materials/Gensim%20word%20vector%20visualization.html
here you can also download other related files.

I have made some changes to make it friendiler,
